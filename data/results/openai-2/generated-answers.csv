  - The second component is the pricing per worker node, which is:
      - $0.171 per 4vCPU/hour for on-demand consumption (or approximately $1498/node/year.)
      - $0.114 per 4vCPU/hour for a 1-year RI commitment (or approximately $998/node/year.)
      - $0.076 per 4vCPU/hour for a 3-year RI commitment (or approximately $665/node/year.)
  - Third, are the underlying AWS infrastructure costs, like EC2 instances, network traffic, S3 buckets, etc. See here for [provisioned resources](https://docs.openshift.com/rosa/rosa_planning/rosa-sts-aws-prereqs.html#rosa-aws-policy-provisioned_rosa-sts-aws-prereqs).
_*OpenShift pricing for Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS is the same for all supported AWS regions. Pricing listed above does not include infrastructure expenses._
**ON-DEMAND PRICING EXAMPLE**
If you have a 10 worker node cluster of type m5.xlarge, running on-demand for a year, the OpenShift cost for Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS would be approximately:
$0.03 /cluster/hour X 1 cluster X 24 hours/day X 365.25 days/year = $263<br>
$0.171 /node/hour X 10 worker nodes X 24 hours/day X 365 days/year = $14,969.60<br>

You can find more information about the ROSA CLI and how to use it to deploy a cluster at the following link: https://docs.openshift.com/rosa/16-deploy_cli.html."
33,What authentication mechanisms are supported with ROSA?,"OpenID Connect (a profile of OAuth2), Google OAuth, GitHub OAuth, GitLab, and LDAP.","
The recommended authentication mechanism for ROSA is AWS STS. This method better aligns with principles of least privilege and is much better aligned to secure practices in cloud service resource management. For more information, please see the section ""[ROSA with STS Explained](15-sts_explained.md)"" for a detailed explanation."
34,How will events such as product updates and scheduled maintenance be communicated?,Red Hat will provide updates via email and Red Hat console service log.,"Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA) customers will be notified of new features and updates through the regular communication channels, including AWS updates and email. Additionally, customers can add notification contacts for their ROSA cluster and subscribed users will receive emails about cluster events that require customer action, known cluster incidents, upgrade maintenance, and other topics. For more information, please refer to the [ROSA Documentation](https://docs.openshift.com/rosa/welcome/index.html)."
35,Does ROSA have a hibernation or shut-down feature for any nodes in the cluster to save costs on infrastructure or to retain a configured cluster for long-term?,"No, not at this time. The shutdown/hibernation feature is an OpenShift platform feature not yet mature enough for widespread cloud services use.","Yes, ROSA supports node autoscaling. Autoscaling allows you to automatically adjust the size of the cluster based on the current workload. You can find more information about autoscaling nodes on a cluster in the ROSA documentation at the following link: https://docs.openshift.com/rosa/rosa_cluster_admin/rosa_nodes/rosa-nodes-about-autoscaling-nodes.html."
36,Is SRE access to clusters secured by MFA?,"Yes, all SRE access is secured by MFA. See [SRE access](https://docs.openshift.com/rosa/rosa_architecture/rosa_policy_service_definition/rosa-policy-process-security.html#rosa-policy-sre-access_rosa-policy-process-security) in the documentation for more details.","If you specify a KMS key to use, the following will be encrypted with that key: control plane, infrastructure and worker node root volumes, along with your persistent volumes. For more information, please refer to the [ROSA Documentation](https://docs.openshift.com/rosa/welcome/index.html)."
37,"What encryption keys, if any, are used in a new ROSA cluster?","We encrypt EBS volumes that we use for ROSA, using a key stored in KMS. Customers have the option to provide their own KMS keys at cluster creation time as well.","Yes, ROSA supports the use of customer-supplied KMS keys for EBS encryption. To configure a cluster with a custom KMS Key, you can refer to the ROSA STS Customizations documentation [here](https://docs.openshift.com/rosa/rosa_install_access_delete_clusters/rosa-sts-creating-a-cluster-with-customizations.html#rosa-sts-creating-cluster-customizations_rosa-sts-creating-a-cluster-with-customizations) and the Deploy ROSA with a Custom KMS Key guide [here](https://mobb.ninja/docs/rosa/kms/).

39,Is data on my cluster encrypted?,"By default, there is encryption at rest. The AWS Storage platform automatically encrypts your data before persisting it, and decrypts the data before retrieval. See [AWS EBS Encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSEncryption.html) details.
There is also the ability to encrypt etcd in the cluster, and that would combine with AWS storage encryption, resulting in double the encryption (redundant), which adds up to 20% performance hit. For further details see [etcd encryption](https://docs.openshift.com/rosa/rosa_policy/rosa-service-definition.html#rosa-sdpolicy-etcd-encryption_rosa-service-definition).","Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA) provides encryption for data stored on the cluster. Data is encrypted at rest using AES-256 encryption. Additionally, data is encrypted in transit using TLS 1.2. For more information, please refer to the [ROSA Security Documentation](https://docs.openshift.com/rosa/4.5/security/index.html)."
40,When can etcd encryption be done with a ROSA cluster?,"Only at cluster creation time, can etcd encryption be enabled.
Note that this incurs additional overhead with negligible security risk mitigation.
See the prior question about EBS encryption.","When creating a ROSA cluster, the following infrastructure is provisioned:
- Virtual Machines
- Storage
- Load Balancers
- Networking
- Security Groups
- IAM Roles
- OpenID Connect (OIDC) Provider

Additionally, customers can add notification contacts for a ROSA cluster. Subscribed users receive emails about cluster events that require customer action, known cluster incidents, upgrade maintenance, and other topics. For more information, please visit the ROSA Webpage at https://www.openshift.com/products/amazon-openshift."
43,"I see there are two ""kinds"" of ROSA clusters. One uses an IAM user with admin permissions and the other AWS STS. Which should I choose?","AWS STS. These aren't ""kinds"" but rather credential methods. Basically, ""how do you grant Red Hat the permissions needed in order to perform the required actions in your AWS account?"". The roadmap forward is focused on STS, and the IAM user method will eventually be deprecated. This better aligns with principles of least privilege and is much better aligned to secure practices in cloud service resource management. Please see the section [ROSA with STS Explained](/rosa/15-sts_explained) for a detailed explanation.","There are currently two supported credential methods when deploying a ROSA cluster. The first method uses an IAM user with the *AdministratorAccess* policy (limited to the AWS account using ROSA) that allows the installer to create all the resources it needs, and allows the cluster to create/expand its own credentials as needed. The second, more recent, and **recommended** method uses AWS STS. This method uses predefined roles and policies to grant the service minimal permissions needed (least-privilege) to the AWS account in order to create and operate the cluster. Please see the section ""[ROSA with STS Explained](15-sts_explained.md)"" for a detailed explanation."
44,"I’m seeing a number of permission or failure errors related to prerequisite tasks or cluster creation, what might be the problem?",Please check for a newer version of the ROSA CLI. Every release of the ROSA CLI lands in two places: [Github](https://github.com/openshift/rosa/releases) and the [Red Hat signed binary releases](https://www.openshift.com/products/rosa/download).,"If you are seeing permission or failure errors related to prerequisite tasks or cluster creation, it is likely due to one of the prerequisites not being met. Ensure that you are logged in as an IAM user and not an assumed role or STS user, that you have administrator access to the AWS account of the cluster, and that you have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role. Additionally, if Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS created a VPC, you must remove any network configurations, such as VPN configurations and VPC peering connections, and any additional services that were added to the VPC before you can successfully delete your cluster. Finally, make sure that you have the Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS CLI (`oc`) installed. For more information, please refer to the ROSA Documentation at https://docs.openshift.com/rosa/welcome/index.html."
45,What are the available storage options?,Please refer to the [storage](https://docs.openshift.com/rosa/rosa_architecture/rosa_policy_service_definition/rosa-service-definition.html#rosa-sdpolicy-storage_rosa-service-definition) section of the service definition.,"Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA) provides two prebuilt storage classes that use AWS Elastic Block Store (EBS) volumes. These storage classes are ready to use and some familiarity with Kubernetes and AWS is assumed. The two storage classes are gp3 and gp3-csi, with gp3 set as the default.

In addition, you can configure storage for the Collector, Ingester, and Query services under `spec.storage`. Multiple instances of each of these components can be provisioned as required for performance and resilience purposes.

For more information, please refer to the following documentation:

46,What options are available to use shared storage in containers?,"AWS EFS (Using AWS EFS CSI Driver, OpenShift includes the CSI driver out of the box in 4.10.). See [Setting up AWS EFS for Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS](https://docs.openshift.com/rosa/storage/persistent_storage/osd-persistent-storage-aws.html).","For Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA), there are several options available for shared storage in containers. These include using persistent volumes, distributed tracing storage, and replicated databases. 

Persistent volumes are attached to single pods and can provide a way to store data that is accessible to multiple containers. This can be used to store data that needs to be shared between containers, such as application configuration or user data.

Distributed tracing storage is used to store data related to distributed tracing. This data is used to track the performance of applications and services. The storage configuration options for distributed tracing can be configured under the `spec.storage` section.

Replicated databases can also be used to provide shared storage for containers. This can be used to store data that needs to be shared between containers, such as application configuration or user data. Replicated databases can provide a more reliable and resilient way to store data than single persistent volumes. 

For more information, please refer to the ROSA Documentation at https://docs.openshift.com/rosa/welcome/index.html."
47,Can I deploy into an already existing VPC and choose the specific subnets?,Yes.  At install time you are able to select whether you’d like to deploy to an existing VPC and then choose that VPC.  You will then be able to select the desired subnets and also provide a valid CIDR range (encompassing the subnets) the installer will handle using those subnets.

50,Can more than one ROSA cluster be set up in one VPC?,"Yes, ROSA allows multiple clusters to share the same VPC. Essentially, the number of clusters would be limited by what AWS resource quota remains, as well as any chosen CIDR ranges that must not overlap. See [CIDR Range Definitions](https://docs.openshift.com/rosa/networking/cidr-range-definitions.html) for more information.","Yes, you can set up more than one ROSA cluster in one VPC. Each cluster will need its own CIDR range that does not overlap with other clusters in the same VPC. You can use AWS VPC peering, AWS VPN, or AWS Direct Connect to configure a private network connection to your ROSA cluster. Additionally, you can use OpenShift User Workload Monitoring to monitor containers and manage capacity using Prometheus/Grafana. For production workloads, it is recommended to deploy ROSA clusters across multiple availability zones for the highest level of fault tolerance."
51,Can I use Prometheus/Grafana to monitor containers and manage capacity?,"Yes, using OpenShift User Workload Monitoring. This is a check-box option in OpenShift Cluster Manager (console.redhat.com/openshift)","Yes, you can use Prometheus/Grafana to monitor containers and manage capacity on Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA). Prometheus is used to collect metrics from the cluster components and Grafana is used to visualize the metrics. You can use the OpenShift monitoring dashboard to run Prometheus Query Language (PromQL) queries to examine metrics visualized on a plot. As a dedicated-admin, you can query one or more namespaces at a time for metrics about user-defined projects. As a developer, you must specify a project name when querying metrics and you must have the required privileges to view metrics for the selected project.

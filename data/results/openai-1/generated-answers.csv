7,How is the pricing of Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS calculated?,"See here for pricing information: [ROSA Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/rosa/pricing/)
Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS has three components to its cost.
  - First there is an hourly cluster fee, which is $0.03/cluster/hour (or approximately $263/cluster/year.)
  - The second component is the pricing per worker node, which is:
      - $0.171 per 4vCPU/hour for on-demand consumption (or approximately $1498/node/year.)
      - $0.114 per 4vCPU/hour for a 1-year RI commitment (or approximately $998/node/year.)
      - $0.076 per 4vCPU/hour for a 3-year RI commitment (or approximately $665/node/year.)
  - Third, are the underlying AWS infrastructure costs, like EC2 instances, network traffic, S3 buckets, etc. See here for [provisioned resources](https://docs.openshift.com/rosa/rosa_planning/rosa-sts-aws-prereqs.html#rosa-aws-policy-provisioned_rosa-sts-aws-prereqs).
_*OpenShift pricing for Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS is the same for all supported AWS regions. Pricing listed above does not include infrastructure expenses._
**ON-DEMAND PRICING EXAMPLE**
If you have a 10 worker node cluster of type m5.xlarge, running on-demand for a year, the OpenShift cost for Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS would be approximately:
$0.03 /cluster/hour X 1 cluster X 24 hours/day X 365.25 days/year = $263<br>
$0.171 /node/hour X 10 worker nodes X 24 hours/day X 365 days/year = $14,969.60<br>
Your total cost in this case would be $15,242<br>
_Pricing for Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS is in addition to the costs of Amazon EC2 for control plane, infra & worker nodes and other AWS services used._","- **Integrated security:** Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS is integrated with AWS security services, such as AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), AWS CloudTrail, and AWS Config.

- [Deploy ROSA with a Custom KMS Key](https://mobb.ninja/docs/rosa/kms/)"
39,Is data on my cluster encrypted?,"By default, there is encryption at rest. The AWS Storage platform automatically encrypts your data before persisting it, and decrypts the data before retrieval. See [AWS EBS Encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSEncryption.html) details.
There is also the ability to encrypt etcd in the cluster, and that would combine with AWS storage encryption, resulting in double the encryption (redundant), which adds up to 20% performance hit. For further details see [etcd encryption](https://docs.openshift.com/rosa/rosa_policy/rosa-service-definition.html#rosa-sdpolicy-etcd-encryption_rosa-service-definition).","

43,"I see there are two ""kinds"" of ROSA clusters. One uses an IAM user with admin permissions and the other AWS STS. Which should I choose?","AWS STS. These aren't ""kinds"" but rather credential methods. Basically, ""how do you grant Red Hat the permissions needed in order to perform the required actions in your AWS account?"". The roadmap forward is focused on STS, and the IAM user method will eventually be deprecated. This better aligns with principles of least privilege and is much better aligned to secure practices in cloud service resource management. Please see the section [ROSA with STS Explained](/rosa/15-sts_explained) for a detailed explanation.","
The “ROSA with STS” method is the preferred and recommended option. It uses predefined roles and policies to grant the service minimal permissions needed (least-privilege) to the AWS account in order to create and operate the cluster. Please see the section ""[ROSA with STS Explained](15-sts_explained.md)"" for a detailed explanation."
44,"I’m seeing a number of permission or failure errors related to prerequisite tasks or cluster creation, what might be the problem?",Please check for a newer version of the ROSA CLI.

51,Can I use Prometheus/Grafana to monitor containers and manage capacity?,"Yes, using OpenShift User Workload Monitoring. This is a check-box option in OpenShift Cluster Manager (console.redhat.com/openshift)","
Grafana

Grafana is an open source analytics and monitoring platform. It allows you to query, visualize, alert on, and understand your metrics no matter where they are stored.

Grafana can be used to monitor the performance of your OpenShift Service on AWS cluster. You can use Grafana to create custom dashboards and alerts for your cluster.

Prometheus alerts

Prometheus alerts are triggered when a metric exceeds a certain threshold. You can configure Prometheus to send alerts to a notification service such as Slack or PagerDuty.

In conclusion, you can use Prometheus/Grafana to monitor containers and manage capacity on ROSA. You can use Prometheus to query and visualize metrics, and Grafana to create custom dashboards and alerts. You can also configure Prometheus to send alerts to a notification service."
52,Can I see audit logs output from the cluster control-plane?,"If the Cluster Logging Operator Add-on has been added to the cluster then audit logs are available through CloudWatch.  If it has not, then a support request would allow you to request some audit logs. Small targeted and time-boxed logs can be requested for export and sent to a customer. The selection of audit logs available are at the discretion of SRE in the category of platform security and compliance. Requests for exports of a cluster’s entirety of logs will be rejected.","

2. Create a Permissions Boundary

You can create a Permissions Boundary to limit the maximum permissions that can be granted to an IAM user, role, or group. This boundary can be used to limit the access to the policies created in the previous step. Please see the [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_boundaries.html) for more details about creating a Permissions Boundary."
54,Do ROSA worker nodes share the same AMI as other OpenShift products?,ROSA worker nodes use a different AMI from OSD and OCP. Control Plane and Infra node AMIs are common across products in the same version.,"
Do ROSA worker nodes share the same AMI as other OpenShift products?
Yes, ROSA worker nodes share the same AMI as other OpenShift products. You receive OpenShift updates with new feature releases and a shared, common source for alignment with OpenShift Container Platform. ROSA supports the same versions of OpenShift as Red Hat OpenShift Dedicated and OpenShift Container Platform to achieve version consistency."
55,Are backups taken for clusters?,"Only non-STS clusters have SRE managed backups at this time, which means that ROSA STS clusters don’t have backups. You can also see our [backup policy](https://docs.openshift.com/rosa/rosa_architecture/rosa_policy_service_definition/rosa-service-definition.html#rosa-sdpolicy-backup-policy_rosa-service-definition). It is imperative for users to have their own backup policies for applications and data.",[https://docs.openshift.com/rosa/4.5/installing_clusters/installing-clusters-aws/installing-clusters-aws-encryption.html](https://docs.openshift.com/rosa/4.5/installing_clusters/installing-clusters-aws/installing-clusters-aws-encryption.html)
56,Is ROSA GDPR Compliant?,Yes: [https://www.redhat.com/en/gdpr](https://www.redhat.com/en/gdpr),"
ROSA is GDPR compliant and provides customers with the ability to manage their data in accordance with GDPR requirements. ROSA provides customers with the ability to set service quotas for their clusters, which helps ensure that their applications are running within the limits of their service agreement. Additionally, customers can add notification contacts to their ROSA cluster to receive emails about cluster events, known cluster incidents, upgrade maintenance, and other topics."
57,Does the ROSA CLI accept Multi-region KMS keys for EBS encryption?,Not at this time. This feature is in our backlog. Though we do accept single region KMS keys for EBS Encryption as long as it is defined at cluster creation time.,"
1. Create a customer-managed KMS key in the same region as the ROSA cluster.
2. Create a ROSA cluster in STS mode with the customer-managed KMS key.
3. Verify that the customer-managed KMS key is being used for encryption.

## Prerequisites

- You have available AWS service quotas.
- You have enabled the ROSA service in the AWS Console.
- You have installed and configured the latest ROSA (`rosa`) and AWS (`aws`) CLIs on your installation host.

## Create a customer-managed KMS key

To successfully install ROSA clusters, use latest version of the ROSA CLI.

If you want to use a customer managed AWS Key Management Service (KMS) key for encryption, you must create a symmetric KMS key. You must provide the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) when creating your cluster. To create a customer managed KMS key, follow the procedure for [Creating symmetric encryption KMS keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/create-keys.html#create-symmetric-cmk).

58,Can I define a custom domain and certificate for my applications?,Yes. See [Configuring custom domains for applications](https://docs.openshift.com/rosa/applications/deployments/osd-config-custom-domains-applications.html) for more information.,"
You can use the [CertificateRequest](https://docs.openshift.com/rosa/api/certificates.cert-manager.io/v1alpha2/kinds/CertificateRequest.html) resource to dynamically issue a Certificate to every new Route. This CertificateRequest resource will be used to generate a Certificate that will be used to secure the Route. The CertificateRequest resource will be configured with the domain name of the Route and the Certificate will be issued with the SAN names of the Route. This will allow you to securely expose multiple applications without having to manually update the Certificate resource."
59,How are the ROSA domain certificates managed?,Red Hat infrastructure (Hive) manages certificate rotation for default application ingress (apps.*.openshiftapps.com),"
The `rosa` CLI is a command-line interface for managing ROSA clusters. It provides a set of commands for managing objects such as users, clusters, and upgrades. It also provides commands for managing certificates and notifications.

To manage certificates, you can use the `rosa certificate` command. This command allows you to add, delete, and list certificates associated with a ROSA cluster.

To manage notifications, you can use the `rosa notification` command. This command allows you to add, delete, and list notification contacts for a ROSA cluster. Subscribed users receive emails about cluster events that require customer action, known cluster incidents, upgrade maintenance, and other topics."

Additionally, spot instances are supported.","
Answer: Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA) supports the following instance types and sizes for worker nodes: m5.metal (96† vCPU, 384 GiB), m5.xlarge (4 vCPU, 16 GiB), m5.2xlarge (8 vCPU, 32 GiB), m5.4xlarge (16 vCPU, 64 GiB), m5.8xlarge (32 vCPU, 128 GiB), m5.12xlarge (48 vCPU, 192 GiB), m5.16xlarge (64 vCPU, 256 GiB), m5.24xlarge (96 vCPU, 384 GiB), m5a.xlarge (4 vCPU, 16 GiB), m5a.2xlarge (8 vCPU, 32 GiB), m5a.4xlarge (16 vCPU, 64 GiB), m5a.8xlarge (32 vCPU, 128 GiB), m5a.12xlarge (48 vCPU, 192 GiB), m5a.16xlarge (64 vCPU, 256 GiB), m5a.24xlarge (96 vCPU, 384 GiB), m"
62,"Does ROSA support an air-gapped, disconnected environment where the ROSA cluster does not have internet access?  ","No, the ROSA cluster must have egress to the internet to access our registry, S3, send metrics etc. The service requires a number of [egress endpoints](https://docs.openshift.com/rosa/rosa_install_access_delete_clusters/rosa_getting_started_iam/rosa-aws-prereqs.html#osd-aws-privatelink-firewall-prerequisites). Ingress can be limited to PrivateLink (for Red Hat SRE) and VPN or similar for customer access.",
63,Is node autoscaling available?,Yes. Autoscaling allows you to automatically adjust the size of the cluster based on the current workload. See [About autoscaling nodes on a cluster](https://docs.openshift.com/rosa/rosa_cluster_admin/rosa_nodes/rosa-nodes-about-autoscaling-nodes.html) in the documentation for more details.,"
You can configure the autoscaler option to automatically scale the number of machines in a cluster. The cluster autoscaler increases the size of the cluster when there are pods that failed to schedule on any of the current nodes due to insufficient resources or when another node is necessary to meet deployment needs. The cluster autoscaler does not increase the cluster resources beyond the limits that you specify. Additionally, the cluster autoscaler decreases the size of the cluster when some nodes are consistently not needed for a significant period, such as when it has low resource use and all of its important pods can fit on other nodes. When you enable autoscaling, you must also set a minimum and maximum number of worker nodes."
64,What is the maximum number of worker nodes that a cluster can support?,The maximum number of worker nodes is 180 per ROSA cluster.  See here for [limits and scalability](https://docs.openshift.com/rosa/rosa_planning/rosa-limits-scalability.html) considerations and more details on node counts.,"
### What is the maximum number of pods per node?
The current maximum number of pods per node is 250. However, the number of pods that fit on a node is dependent on the application itself. Consider the application’s memory, CPU, and storage requirements, as described in [Planning your environment based on application requirements](https://docs.openshift.com/rosa/rosa_planning/rosa-planning-environment.html)."

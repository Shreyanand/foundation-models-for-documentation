7,How is the pricing of Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS calculated?,"See here for pricing information: [ROSA Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/rosa/pricing/)
Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS has three components to its cost.
  - First there is an hourly cluster fee, which is $0.03/cluster/hour (or approximately $263/cluster/year.)
  - The second component is the pricing per worker node, which is:
      - $0.171 per 4vCPU/hour for on-demand consumption (or approximately $1498/node/year.)
      - $0.114 per 4vCPU/hour for a 1-year RI commitment (or approximately $998/node/year.)
      - $0.076 per 4vCPU/hour for a 3-year RI commitment (or approximately $665/node/year.)
  - Third, are the underlying AWS infrastructure costs, like EC2 instances, network traffic, S3 buckets, etc. See here for [provisioned resources](https://docs.openshift.com/rosa/rosa_planning/rosa-sts-aws-prereqs.html#rosa-aws-policy-provisioned_rosa-sts-aws-prereqs).
_*OpenShift pricing for Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS is the same for all supported AWS regions. Pricing listed above does not include infrastructure expenses._
**ON-DEMAND PRICING EXAMPLE**
If you have a 10 worker node cluster of type m5.xlarge, running on-demand for a year, the OpenShift cost for Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS would be approximately:
$0.03 /cluster/hour X 1 cluster X 24 hours/day X 365.25 days/year = $263<br>
$0.171 /node/hour X 10 worker nodes X 24 hours/day X 365 days/year = $14,969.60<br>
Your total cost in this case would be $15,242<br>
_Pricing for Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS is in addition to the costs of Amazon EC2 for control plane, infra & worker nodes and other AWS services used._"," The pricing of Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS is calculated with an hourly cluster fee of $0.03/cluster/hour, a pricing per worker node of $0.171 per 4vCPU/hour for on-demand consumption, and the underlying AWS infrastructure costs."
8,"When pricing out my EC2 instances, do I need to use RHEL for the operating system?","No, being that ROSA includes Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) as the operating system, you only need to choose Linux.

39,Is data on my cluster encrypted?,"By default, there is encryption at rest. The AWS Storage platform automatically encrypts your data before persisting it, and decrypts the data before retrieval. See [AWS EBS Encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSEncryption.html) details.
There is also the ability to encrypt etcd in the cluster, and that would combine with AWS storage encryption, resulting in double the encryption (redundant), which adds up to 20% performance hit. For further details see [etcd encryption](https://docs.openshift.com/rosa/rosa_policy/rosa-service-definition.html#rosa-sdpolicy-etcd-encryption_rosa-service-definition).", The information provided does not indicate whether data on the cluster is encrypted or not.
40,When can etcd encryption be done with a ROSA cluster?,"Only at cluster creation time, can etcd encryption be enabled.
Note that this incurs additional overhead with negligible security risk mitigation.
See the prior question about EBS encryption.", It is not specified when etcd encryption can be done with a ROSA cluster.
41,How is etcd encryption configured in a ROSA cluster?,The same as in OCP. The aescbc cypher is used and the setting is patched during cluster deployment.

For further details see [etcd encryption](https://docs.openshift.com/rosa/rosa_policy/rosa-service-definition.html#rosa-sdpolicy-etcd-encryption_rosa-service-definition).," Etcd encryption in a ROSA cluster is configured the same as in OCP, using the aescbc cypher and patched during cluster deployment."
42,What infrastructure is provisioned as part of a new ROSA cluster?,"ROSA makes use of a number of different cloud services such as virtual machines, storage, load balancers, etc. You can see a defined list in the [AWS prerequisites](https://docs.openshift.com/rosa/rosa_planning/rosa-sts-aws-prereqs.html#rosa-aws-policy-provisioned_rosa-sts-aws-prereqs)."," A new ROSA cluster is provisioned with at least three control plane nodes and three infrastructure nodes that are preconfigured for high availability, and notification contacts can be added for subscribed users to receive emails about cluster events."
43,"I see there are two ""kinds"" of ROSA clusters. One uses an IAM user with admin permissions and the other AWS STS. Which should I choose?","AWS STS. These aren't ""kinds"" but rather credential methods. Basically, ""how do you grant Red Hat the permissions needed in order to perform the required actions in your AWS account?"". The roadmap forward is focused on STS, and the IAM user method will eventually be deprecated. This better aligns with principles of least privilege and is much better aligned to secure practices in cloud service resource management. Please see the section [ROSA with STS Explained](/rosa/15-sts_explained) for a detailed explanation.", The recommended method for creating a ROSA cluster is to use AWS STS.
44,"I’m seeing a number of permission or failure errors related to prerequisite tasks or cluster creation, what might be the problem?",Please check for a newer version of the ROSA CLI. Every release of the ROSA CLI lands in two places: [Github](https://github.com/openshift/rosa/releases) and the [Red Hat signed binary releases](https://www.openshift.com/products/rosa/download)., The problem might be that the user is not logged in as an IAM user and not an assumed role or STS user.
45,What are the available storage options?,Please refer to the [storage](https://docs.openshift.com/rosa/rosa_architecture/rosa_policy_service_definition/rosa-service-definition.html#rosa-sdpolicy-storage_rosa-service-definition) section of the service definition.," The available storage options are configuring storage for the Collector, Ingester, and Query services under `spec.storage`."
46,What options are available to use shared storage in containers?,"AWS EFS (Using AWS EFS CSI Driver, OpenShift includes the CSI driver out of the box in 4.10.). See [Setting up AWS EFS for Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS](https://docs.openshift.com/rosa/storage/persistent_storage/osd-persistent-storage-aws.html)."," The two options available to use shared storage in containers are using static IAM user credentials with AdministratorAccess policy and using AWS Security Token Service (STS) with short-lived, dynamic tokens."
47,Can I deploy into an already existing VPC and choose the specific subnets?,Yes.  At install time you are able to select whether you’d like to deploy to an existing VPC and then choose that VPC.  You will then be able to select the desired subnets and also provide a valid CIDR range (encompassing the subnets) the installer will handle using those subnets. Please see the [VPC](https://docs.openshift.com/rosa/rosa_planning/rosa-sts-aws-prereqs.html#rosa-vpc_rosa-sts-aws-prereqs) section in the documentation for further details.," Yes, you can deploy into an already existing VPC and choose the specific subnets."

50,Can more than one ROSA cluster be set up in one VPC?,"Yes, ROSA allows multiple clusters to share the same VPC. Essentially, the number of clusters would be limited by what AWS resource quota remains, as well as any chosen CIDR ranges that must not overlap. See [CIDR Range Definitions](https://docs.openshift.com/rosa/networking/cidr-range-definitions.html) for more information."," Yes, ROSA allows multiple clusters to share the same VPC."
51,Can I use Prometheus/Grafana to monitor containers and manage capacity?,"Yes, using OpenShift User Workload Monitoring. This is a check-box option in OpenShift Cluster Manager (console.redhat.com/openshift)"," Yes, you can use Prometheus/Grafana to monitor containers and manage capacity."
52,Can I see audit logs output from the cluster control-plane?,"If the Cluster Logging Operator Add-on has been added to the cluster then audit logs are available through CloudWatch.  If it has not, then a support request would allow you to request some audit logs. Small targeted and time-boxed logs can be requested for export and sent to a customer. The selection of audit logs available are at the discretion of SRE in the category of platform security and compliance. Requests for exports of a cluster’s entirety of logs will be rejected.", If the Cluster Logging Operator Add-on has been added to the cluster then audit logs are available through CloudWatch.

61,What kind of instances are supported for worker nodes?,"See [AWS compute types](https://docs.openshift.com/rosa/rosa_architecture/rosa_policy_service_definition/rosa-service-definition.html#rosa-sdpolicy-aws-instance-types_rosa-service-definition) in the service definition for the up to date list of supported instance types.  Additionally, spot instances are supported."," Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS offers the following worker node instance types and sizes: m5.metal (96† vCPU, 384 GiB), m5.xlarge (4 vCPU, 16 GiB), m5.2xlarge (8 vCPU, 32 GiB), m5.4xlarge (16 vCPU, 64 GiB), m5.8xlarge (32 vCPU, 128 GiB), m5.12xlarge (48 vCPU, 192 GiB), m5.16xlarge (64 vCPU, 256 GiB), m5.24xlarge (96 vCPU, 384 GiB), m5a.xlarge (4 vCPU, 16 GiB), m5a.2xlarge (8 vCPU, 32 GiB), m5a.4xlarge (16 vCPU, 64 GiB), m5a.8xlarge (32 vCPU, 128 GiB), m5a.12xlarge (48 vCPU, 192 GiB), m5a.16xlarge (64 vCPU, 256 GiB), m5a.24xlarge (96 vCPU, 384 GiB), m5ad.xlarge (4 vCPU"
62,"Does ROSA support an air-gapped, disconnected environment where the ROSA cluster does not have internet access?  ","No, the ROSA cluster must have egress to the internet to access our registry, S3, send metrics etc. The service requires a number of [egress endpoints](https://docs.openshift.com/rosa/rosa_install_access_delete_clusters/rosa_getting_started_iam/rosa-aws-prereqs.html#osd-aws-privatelink-firewall-prerequisites). Ingress can be limited to PrivateLink (for Red Hat SRE) and VPN or similar for customer access."," No, the ROSA cluster must have egress to the internet to access our registry, S3, send metrics etc."
63,Is node autoscaling available?,Yes. Autoscaling allows you to automatically adjust the size of the cluster based on the current workload. See [About autoscaling nodes on a cluster](https://docs.openshift.com/rosa/rosa_cluster_admin/rosa_nodes/rosa-nodes-about-autoscaling-nodes.html) in the documentation for more details., Node autoscaling is available and can be configured to automatically scale the number of machines in a cluster.
64,What is the maximum number of worker nodes that a cluster can support?,The maximum number of worker nodes is 180 per ROSA cluster.  See here for [limits and scalability](https://docs.openshift.com/rosa/rosa_planning/rosa-limits-scalability.html) considerations and more details on node counts., The maximum number of worker nodes that a cluster can support is 180.
